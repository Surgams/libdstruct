# libdstruct
Datastructure library for C language, originally inspired by a text book during university days. I rewrote it now with complete Unit test and full demo classes.

Build and tested on FreeBSD. 

## Currently supposrt the below types:
- List
- Queue
- Stack
- Hash Map
- Set
- Array Stack
- Aarray Queue

For use please check the The **test** and the **demos** folders.

## Build
$ cd src
$ make

## Run Test
$ cd test
$ make

## Installation
$ cd src
$ sudo make install clean

## Deinstallation
$ cd src
$ sudo make deinstall

This will build both static and dynamic libraries.
